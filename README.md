## Introduction
- In this project, I get familiar with event handling. 
Users are able to post a new tweet, like/unlike a tweet, retweet/unretweet and see replies and post replies to existing tweets.
This is fixed as one user avatar. I also use localStorage to ensure that changes made to the data are persistent to users on the next visit.
